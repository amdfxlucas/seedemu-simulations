This simulation is generated from the 'tiny_test_sample_multi.gml' GML topology file.

Which in turn is generated from the 'full_geo_rel.xml' CAIDA dataset (11182x ASes,diameter 11, connected graph)
by selecting 5x ASes (hypothetic multicast capable 'terminals' )at random,
(namely: 33154, 62454, 14909, 5564, 23467 )
and adding just as much other ASes from the dataset (that forward the traffic between them)
for the graph to be connected (so the 5x ASes can communicate with each other)
The resulting graph has only diameter 4.
A minimum steiner tree that connects the 5x terminals has 9x edges.

provider = GMLDataProvider("examples/scion/S07-multicast/tiny_test_sample_multi.gml")

The mapping of real world ASN to AS-Aliases is as follows:
'33154': 2
'2914':  3
'13030': 4
'3303':  5
'553':   6
'42':    7
'23467': 8
'559':   9
'62454': 10
'1239':  11
'5564':  12
'6939':  13
'3356':  14
'14909': 15

In the simulation AS 1-14 serves as the Core AS of the ISD '1' to which all ASes belong.
(this is due to a limitation of seed-emulator, which as of writing only supports a single ISD)
