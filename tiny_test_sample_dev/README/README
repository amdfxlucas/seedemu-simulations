This simulation is generated from the 'tiny_test_sample_multi.gml' GML topology file.

Which in turn is generated from the 'full_geo_rel.xml' CAIDA dataset (diameter 11)
by selecting 5x ASes (hypothetic multicast capable )at random,
 and adding just as much other ASes from the dataset for the graph to be connected
 (so the 5x ASes can communicate with each other)
 The resulting graph has only diameter 4.

provider = GMLDataProvider("examples/scion/S07-multicast/tiny_test_sample_multi.gml")

The mapping of real world ASN to AS-Aliases is as follows:
'33154': 2
'2914':  3
'13030': 4
'3303':  5
'553':   6
'42':    7
'23467': 8
'559':   9
'62454': 10
'1239':  11
'5564':  12
'6939':  13
'3356':  14
'14909': 15
